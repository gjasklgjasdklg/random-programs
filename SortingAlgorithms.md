## What is a Bubble Sort?

- - - -

A bubble sort is named this because the items are said to "bubble" into their correct spots.

**It works as follows:**

1. The first two items (e.g. index 0 and 1) within an array are compared.
2. If they are not in the required order, their positions in the array are swapped round. 
3. The next two items (e.g. 1 and 2) are then compared. This process continues until the algorithm gets to the end of the list. This is known as a pass.
4. Passes are repeated until there are no more swaps to make, and the array is sorted.
